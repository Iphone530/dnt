            <ul>
                <li>
                    to support the ability of user agents to determine and possibly record
                    the information presented to individuals when they are asked to give their
                    consent for tracking, such as the reasons for why data is collected,
                    and what it will be used for.
                    User agents can then make this information available to users, for example whenever they request it,
                    helping to meet the transparency requirements of European data protection/privacy law.
                </li>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The GDPR requires that the identity of origin server is discoverable by web users,
            and the [[TPE]] supports this by enabling every origin server to identify
            itself by hosting a Tracking Status Resource (TSR) at the /.well-known/dnt/ location.
            This specification further requires that the information presented to a user
            before they agreed to a Tracking Exception, i.e. gave their informed consent
            for the collection and further processing of personal data derived from on-line
            activity, is permanently determinable from the TSR. 
            As cookie headers <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/#status-checks-not-tracked'>SHOULD be present</a>
            in the TSR request, servers can use them, or an identifier encoded in the DNT header as
            described in this specification, to determine
            what purposes the user has agreed to, and present them in a human-readable
            document pointed to by a new "purposes" TSR property. As cookies may not always be available to third-party
            requests the DNT encoded identifier could be a more reliable way to do it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As well as introducing universal mechanisms for delivering machine-readable
            transparency information, and conveying a signal indicating individuals
            consent or otherwise for tracking in the DNT request header,
            the [[TPE]], via the Site-Specific Tracking Exception, introduced the ability to
            communicate this consent signal efficiently to embedded third-parties.
            Publishers can use this to signal immediately to third-parties
            when users have given consent, and the reverse when consent expires or is withdrawn.
            Under the GDPR consent must be "specific", meaning this signal must be
            capable of being selectively delivered to those parties to which
            the user has given their agreement, and this is supported by the API by allowing DNT:0
            only to be sent to named embedded third-parties. Furthermore, when the user withdraws their consent, 
            or has never given it, the opted-in/opted-out indication is restricted to a particular site
            - opting-out does not have to apply to the whole web, as it does when only
            standard third-party HTTP cookies are available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although a single boolean, indicating consent/no-consent, can be delivered this way, i.e. site-specifically
            via the <a>DNT</a> header,
            there is currently no way to do this similarly for data.
            HTTP cookies are intrinsically web-wide, once stored they will always be included in
            resource requests, whether to embedded third-parties or to first-party websites.
            The privacy concerns arising from this has led to cookies being increasingly blocked in third-party requests,
            either by the browser or by user action. 
            Even when they are available users are much less likely to give their consent to tracking when there is 
            no guarantee it will be constrained to one site, or a defined subset of sites.
            This means that if the user has agreed to site-specific tracking,
            say within a publishers first-party site,
            the persisted information has to recorded in a first-party cookie and communicated
            to embedded third-parties somehow. Even if this can be done in a scalable way, for example by editing
            the target URL with a mutually agreed encoding, the third-party could not persist it in one of its own cookies, because
            even if cookies were not blocked the tracking data would then be available web-wide, 
            i.e on any site which embedded the same third-party.
        </p>
        <p>
            This specification describes the ability for first-parties to efficiently communicate
            site-specific values to embedded third-party servers,
            but only after the user
            has agreed to a site-specific Tracking Exception indicating consent. 
            This value is communicated to server in the DNT request header,
            and to their associated browsing contexts in the 
            <code>navigator.doNotTrack</code> property.The data would be immediately available to the third-party server within the request, so
            there would be no need for additional round-trip delays. Like cookies, it would be available in all requests to the domain, i.e. not just to particular resources,
            and it would not need to be separately persisted. The value could be encoded by first-party script at any time, for any purpose for which then user had agreed, 
            and there would be no need for the logistically complex and inefficient mechanisms needed for user-specific URL editing. 
            The value is only transmitted to, or available to, first-party or embedded third-party servers in the context of a single site, or defined subset of the web, and this could be readily and externally verified.
        </p>
        <p>
            As further security measures this value would only be settable when the registering API call is made within a user gesture,
            similar to the way the WebKit [[StorageAPI]] <code>requestStorageAccess()</code> is constrained, 
            and only when the request is secure, i.e. delivered over <code>https</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Browsers SHOULD support an ability to indicate to the user when a DNT header is carrying
            a site-specific value, say in the browser chrome. How this information interacts with browser specific anti-tracking features is left to browser vendors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tracking Exception API has been extended to support the ability of servers
            to register a site-specific Tracking Exception value of "1", useful in situations 
            where a user has not configured their browser with a general Tracking Preference, and
            servers are legally required to support a signal to indicate the right-to-object, for example 
            under the GDPR's Article 21.5.'

                When a user has enabled a tracking preference, that
                preference needs to be expressed to all mechanisms that might
                perform or initiate tracking.
            </p>
            <p>
                When          enabled, a tracking preference is expressed as either:
            </p>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr>
                    <th>DNT</th>
                    <th>meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>This user prefers not to be tracked on this request.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>This user prefers to allow tracking on this request.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                A user agent MUST NOT send a tracking preference expression if
                a tracking preference is not enabled.  This means that no
                expression is sent for each of the following cases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the user agent does not implement this protocol;</li>
                <li>
                    the user has not yet made a choice for a specific preference;
                    or,
                </li>
                <li>the user has chosen not to transmit a preference.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the absence of regulatory, legal, or other requirements, servers
                MAY interpret the lack of an expressed tracking preference as they
                find most appropriate for the given user, particularly when
                considered in light of the user's privacy expectations and cultural
                circumstances. Likewise, servers might make use of other preference
                information outside the scope of this protocol, such as
                site-specific user preferences or third-party registration services,
                to inform or adjust their behavior when no explicit preference is
                expressed via this protocol.

            <p>
                The <code><dfn>DNT</dfn></code> header field is a mechanism for expressing the
                user's tracking preference in an HTTP request ([[!RFC7230]]).
                At most one <code>DNT</code> header field can be present in a valid request.

            </pre>
            <p>
                A user agent MUST NOT generate a <code>DNT</code> header field if the
                user's tracking preference is  not enabled.
            </p>
            <p>
                A user agent MUST generate a <code>DNT</code> header field with a
                field-value that begins with the numeric character "1" if the user's
                tracking preference is enabled, their preference is for
                DNT:1, and no exception has been granted for the

                tracking preference is enabled and their preference is for

                A proxy MUST NOT generate a <code>DNT</code> header field unless it has

    <h4>The <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn">DNT-Consent</dfn> qualifier</h4>
    <p>
        When a domain origin implements tracking for multiple distinct
        purposes, and these are described to the user before they are
        given the option to agree to one or more of them, the subset of
        purposes the user has selected must be communicated back to the
        origin. While cookies may be used for this, they may not be
        always available, and in any case an embedding parent context,
        e.g. a first-party origin, would not be able to set them for
        origins it had embedded.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a>DNT-Consent</a> qualifier allows an arbitrarily encoded
        string to be communicated to servers solely in
        circumstances where the user has given their informed consent.
        It is denoted by "0" followed by one or more alphanumeric characters.
        The JavaScript Site-Specific <a href="#exception-javascript-api-store" class="sectionRef">storeTrackingException API</a>,
        with a <code>site</code>dictionary property not set to "*", must be used to specify
        a DNT field-value containing the <a>DNT-Consent</a> qualifier,
        which can be encoded in any way that the relevent server that receives it can decode.
        The browsing context executing it must be secure, i.e. the content has been delivered over <code>https</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an origin server specifies a <a>DNT-Consent</a> qualifier it
        MUST implement a site-wide tracking status resource with a valid <a>Purposes</a> property.
        The <a>Purposes</a> property is a dynamically determined HTML resource
        containing a human-readable explanation of all the purposes for tracking that a domain origin implements, as well as the specific purposes a particular user has agreed
        to as communicated in the DNT header of the request to the site-wide tracking status resource.
    </p>
    <p>
        Browsers MUST make it easy for users to see if a <a>DNT-Consent</a> qualifier has been specified for any page and/or any
        of the embedded third-parties on the page, and MUST offer the ability to immediately cancel the associated Tracking Exception
        should they want.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a request containing  <pre>DNT:0 purpose=an,ad</pre>
        would indicate that the user had given consent for tracking, but solely for the purposes of analytics and advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, a request to a particular third-party server containing  <pre>DNT:0 audience=male>65</pre>
        would indicate that the user had given consent for an audience indication to be sent from the publisher to
        that third-party.

            <h3>JavaScript Property to Detect Preference</h3>

            <p>
                The <code><dfn>navigator.doNotTrack</dfn></code> property enables
                a client-side script with read access to the
                <code><dfn data-cite="!HTML51/webappapis.html#the-navigator-object">Navigator</dfn></code> object
                [[!HTML51]] to determine what <a>DNT</a> header field value would be
                sent to the effective script origin, taking into account the
                user's general preference (if any) and user-granted exceptions
                applicable to the target domain when referenced by the
                active document's top-level browsing context.
            </p>
            <pre class="idl">
        partial interface Navigator {
            readonly attribute DOMString? doNotTrack;
        };
      </pre>
            <p>
                The value is <code>null</code> if no DNT header field would be
                sent (e.g., because a tracking preference is <a>not enabled</a>
                and no user-granted exception is applicable);
                otherwise, the value is a string beginning with "0" or "1",
                possibly followed by DNT-extension characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, the value of <a>Navigator.doNotTrack</a> for a given
                script is either <code>null</code> or the string value that would be
                sent in a <a>DNT</a> field-value
                (<a href="#dnt-header-field" class="sectionRef"></a>)
                in a request to a target resource at the
                effective script origin (the current <code>document.domain</code> of
                the script's responsible document) when that request is due to
                an embedded reference from this site (the <code>document.domain</code> of
                the top-level browsing context's active document).
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, the value of <a>navigator.doNotTrack</a> ought to reflect
                the current set of user-granted exceptions in effect when the
                attribute is read.

                    If a user agent presents these properties to the user, it ought to

                <p>
                    In addition to the data above, a user agent might also store
                    ambient information about the call, such as the URI associated
                    with the top-level browsing context,
                    the effective script origin, a current timestamp, or other

                </p>
                <p>
                    The calling script domain MUST have a

                    <a href="#status-representation">tracking status representation</a>
                    that includes a policy property.
                    This allows a user agent to obtain and possibly store additional
                    information about the caller’s controller and tracking
                    policies at the time an exception is granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A user agent MAY reject the promise with a <a>DOMException</a>
                    named "InvalidStateError" if it cannot determine the
                    effective script origin or if the site corresponding to that
                    origin does not have a

                <p>
                    For each site-specific exception being stored,
                    a user agent MUST NOT store the duplets and MUST reject the
                    promise with a <a>DOMException</a> named "SecurityError"
                    if the script would not be able to set a cookie on that duplet's
                    referring domain scope following the cookie domain rules [[!RFC6265]].
                </p>
                <p class="example">
                    For example, a script on <em>www.foo.bar.example.com</em> can set
                    the <a data-link-for="TrackingExData">site</a> as
                    <code>"bar.example.com"</code> or
                    <code>"example.com"</code>, but not to
                    <code>"something.else.example.com"</code> or <code>"com"</code>.

                <p>
                    For each web-wide exception being stored,

                    promise with a <a>DOMException</a> named "SecurityError"

                    domain following the cookie domain rules [[!RFC6265]].
                    This limits storing of a web-wide exception to scripts that share
                    the same domain scope as the exception targets, but allows such
                    scripts to be embedded within iframes of a common consent portal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any other failure, such as an incorrectly formatted parameter in
                    the <a>TrackingExData</a>, the user agent MUST NOT store
                    any of the target duplets in the database and MUST reject the promise
                    with a <a>DOMException</a> named "SyntaxError".

                <p>
                    <a>Upon fulfillment</a>, the user agent has added to its local
                    database one or more site-pair duplets [site, target], each
                    indicating that a request from that site domain to the
                    target domain will include DNT:0 regardless of the
                    user's general tracking preference. The fulfilled promise object
                    contains the following <a>TrackingExResult</a> attribute:

                    <dd>
                        <code>true</code> if the user agent stored a potentially
                        broader exception that applies to all domains (as opposed to just
                        the listed targets); otherwise, <code>false</code>.

                    is supplied for a site-specific exception,
                    the user agent MAY ignore that list, choosing instead to
                    store a site-specific exception for all domains
                    (<code>[site,&nbsp;*]</code>), if it also indicates that result by
                    setting the returned promise's
                    <a data-link-for="TrackingExResult">isSiteWide</a> property

                <p>
                    User agents MAY instantiate <a>Navigator.storeTrackingException</a>
                    even when <a>Navigator.doNotTrack</a> is null. Scripts SHOULD test
                    for the existence of <a>Navigator.storeTrackingException</a> before
                    calling the method.

                <p class="note" id="api-security">
                    There are some security concerns here regarding the ability of a
                    script with an effective script origin matching one site
                    being able to persist the DNT value received by resources on other
                    (target) sites. In particular, this feature could be abused to
                    set/unset an array of exceptions, similar to an array of bit values,
                    and be "read" as a persistent identifier by embedding requests to
                    those domains (which might all point to the same Internet host).
                    However, we expect that would leave an obvious trail on the
                    user agent, unlike other sources of fingerprinting.<br />
                    <br />
                    Likewise, allowing an exception to be stored within an iframe of
                    another site's page could be ripe for abuse unless the calling
                    script ensures that it is being run within a page where it expects
                    to be collecting user consent and where the context of that consent
                    is consistent with the exceptions being stored.<br />
                    <br />
                    This design is consistent with the fact that there is no technical
                    restraint from sites calling the API without having first obtained
                    an informed consent from the user. We are assuming that the social
                    and regulatory environment will be sufficient to punish
                    those who might misuse the API or abuse the scope of stored
                    exceptions. A user agent might further limit such risks by checking
                    for a site-wide tracking status resource when its presence is
                    required by the API.

            <h3>Fingerprinting</h3>

            <p>
                Information communicated via the DNT header field is minimized to
                avoid abuse of the field for fingerprinting or as a side-channel.
                However, the <a>DNT-Consent</a> extension allows for the sending of additional
                information when signaling consent for tracking via DNT:0, and could
                be used to send persistent state information without the user's knowledge.
                For this reason browsers MUST NOT register a <a>DNT-Consent</a> value when the browsing context
                is insecure, the <a>Navigator.storeTrackingException</a> call is for a web-wide Tracking Exception,
                or was not processed in the context of a user gesture.
