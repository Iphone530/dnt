This Note is a final outcome of the standardization process by the Tracking Protection Working Group for the extensions to HTTP known variously as DNT, Do Not Track, or Tracking Protection Expression.

The Working Group closed on 18 January 2019.

Since its last publication as a Candidate Recommendation, there has not been sufficient deployment of these extensions (as defined) to justify further advancement, nor have there been indications of planned support among user agents, third parties, and the ecosystem at large. The working group has therefore decided to conclude its work and republish the final product as this Note, with any future addendums to be published separately.
